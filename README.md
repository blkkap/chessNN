# CHESS NN built with no knowledge of how to build one at all........


## How will this be accompolished? 
- What do we need for a NN to work? 
  - Data of chess games to train it on
  - States of chess pieces - Some type of class 
  - UI to play the game
  

## Features for input layer
- valid moves? 
- Each valid move for each piece? 
  - Pawn
  - Rook
  - Knight
  - Bishop
  - Queen
  - King : old thought process



: new thought process

- other players moves

## Hidden Layer
- Calculations made based off associated weight and basis based off input features 

## Output layer
- Output user player best move responding to input feature




# Activation Function 
- Mathmatical functions that allow the NN to learn complex patterns based off of the data

# Loss Function
- Used to help optimize NN perdictions


## Whats been stared:
- Chess Board -> Acts as a generator for valid moves
- Chess NN : Starting over 


## What we still need:
- Engine -> List of possible moves and best move
  - Search algo
    - Minimax
    - MCTS -> implememt later after MInimax




# Everything above is garbage... well not everything

## TODO LIST
- figure out how chess engines work and if the above is possible
- get dataset
  - clean dataset
- set features
- Build NN
- Optimizer/loss
- Train loop
- train/test'
- Eval (maybe)
